## Rule

7. When considering approval of a Procedural Action, the Board may do so rather than by motion-approval, by unanimous consent. 
8. If an action may be approved by unanimous consent, then the Speaker shall indicate the action to the approved and call for objections. If, after a reasonable period of time the Speaker may determine, no objections are raised, then unanimous consent is granted and the action is approved. Otherwise, unanimous consent is not granted, and the action may be considered through alternative means or disposed of.
9. It is not a failure of the Speaker if they neglect to seek unanimous consent on a Procedural Action.
10. For greater certainty, if unanimous consent is sought and granted for a Substantive Action, the action is not considered approved.
11. It is not a failure of the Speaker if they negligently seak unanimous consent on a Substantive Action, unless they actually knew, or should have known the action was considered substantive. 
12. For greater certainty, objections raised by non-members in attendance do not impact the ability to obtain unanimous consent.
13. Except where explicitly requested, clauses 7-12 shall not apply to an action to reject admission of an outside attendee from a meeting, or to expell an outside attendee from a meeting.
